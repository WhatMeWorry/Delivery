For example, instead of browsing C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Roaming, you can simply open the Run command (Windows key + R), 
type %APPDATA%, and hit Enter to access the same path. Or you can use the %HOMEPATH% variable to access the current user default 
folders location — where the operating system stores the folders for Desktop, Documents, Downloads, OneDrive, etc.

In this guide, you’ll learn the list of the most common environment variables you can use on Windows 10.

%PSModulePath%             %SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules\

Although you can use environment variables to quickly access certain locations within Windows 10, you’ll typically use these 
variable when building an script or an application. Keep in mind that some of the variables mentioned are not location specific, 
including %COMPUTERNAME%, %PATHEXT%, %PROMPT%, %USERDOMAIN%, %USERNAME%. While this guide is focused on Windows 10, it’s important 
to note that these variable will also work on Windows 8.x, Windows 7, and Windows Vista.


==============================================================================================================

HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH is where the user's personal files are: downloads, music, documents, etc.
HOMESHARE is used instead of 
HOMEDRIVE if the home directory uses UNC paths.

USERPROFILE is used to store the user's application and OS configuration files and personalization settings. 
It includes both local and roaming (Active Directory) folders. It seems like people favor using this more than 
HOMEPATH nowadays.

It's important to note that although HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH is often the same path as USERPROFILE, it's not always the case.

USERPROFILE is set by userenv!LoadUserProfileW which is called when, well, loading the user's profile 
(the HKEY_USERS\<sid> hive).


This typically happens the first time a process is started for the user. If you specifically arranged not to load the 
profile (e.g. with /noprofile for runas) then the process is run in the Default User profile which still has this 
variable set - since the moment it was loaded at system's startup.

HOMEDRIVE, HOMEPATH and HOMESHARE (as well as several other variables) are set by 
shell32!RegenerateUserEnvironment which is called on Explorer initialization1. They are placed in the (volatile) 
HKCU\Volatile Environment key which, being volatile, persists until the profile's unload.


==================================================================================================================

A lot of software installation dialogs on Windows throw up a query to the installing user asking if this software should be installed for all 
users or the current user.

Consequently, they are only set when the user logins into their desktop session. NOT for secondary logons or services.
No wonder people prefer USERPROFILE nowadays. For HOMEPATH to be set, SYSTEM must have permissions for the profile's 
directory (they are initially set, of course, but may vanish when e.g. playing with Cygwin's chmod).


In a nutshell...

Install For All Users would be used when you want the program to be "active" for anyone who logs on to the computer 
with their personal account (if there is more than one login). A good example would be an antivirus program, that 
you would want to be available while any user is logged in.

Install for Current User is normally used under an Administrator account for something that handles disk operations 
and other admin-type functions, such as Acronis True Image, a keylogger (to track what non-admin users are doing while 
logged on), and other disk-related or sensitive software.

I will also point out that Install for Current User is often used to install regular programs when a user does not 
have admin rights. A lot of programs now have options that will allow standard users to install a program for their 
account only if they are not an administrator. Generally, administrative rights are required to install a program for 
all users but not always for just the current user.
