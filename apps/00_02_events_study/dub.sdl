// If common is not an independent project (it has no dub configuration) 
// then you can use `sourcePaths` (or `sourceFiles`) in the dub configuration 
// of any projects that need it.

// Or you could copy it around into the source directory of any project that 
// uses it and dub will compile it automatically

importPaths ".."  // importPaths "../"  also works as well
