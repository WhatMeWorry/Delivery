remove std.experimental.logger's capability to set the minimal LogLevel at compile time

Before this change std.experimental.logger had the capability to disable
logging at compile time.
It was also possible to set the minimal LogLevel at compile time.
The trade-off between gained capability, added complexity, and error-proneness
was too heavily tilted towards the second two items.
This change removes these compile time features.
